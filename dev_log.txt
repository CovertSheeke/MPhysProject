Rundown

-Got access to noether
-Got familiar with pulling galaxy population properties
-Still only using copy pastes of other people's code
-Made plots of:
    -Galaxy mass histogram at different redshift (why the low mass cutoff? intrinsic or observational/algorithmic)
    - BH Mass v Vel Disp (not linear on log-log as expected, is this a simulation issue?)
    - Metallicity v M* (good slope, too negative after the knee)
    - M* v M_DM-halo (looks about right when compared to eagle, and observation)
    - mass of a subhalo undergoing mergers
-When making 2dhist include array of bin edges (log data should be logged outside of plot)

Goals

Mergers:
    -merger information from progenitors and descendents
    -merger statistics for the population

Git
    -setup and backup at end of the day

#########
Notes:
- hubble constant 'little h' in units of [100 km/s/Mpc]	0.704
- always include units with data grabs
- always manipulate graph separately to data manipulation + data grab or all in the same cell

Rundown

-had trouble with h5py locking, edited the illustris library files as the normal .bashrc fix wasn't doing anything
